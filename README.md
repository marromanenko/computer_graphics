## laba1 Algorithms for rasterization of graphic primitives 

**Purpose:** 
to get acquainted with the methods of rasterization of graphic primitives in practical experience.

**Problem statement:**
Programmatically implement algorithms for rasterization of segments and circles using pseudo-pixels of size NxN.

**Algorithms for rasterization:**
